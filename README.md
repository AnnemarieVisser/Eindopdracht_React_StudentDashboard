# React Student Dashboard

This project is created as the final assignment of the Frontend development couse of Winc Academy. 

## First challenge
Create a student dashboard that shows the average scores of the various modules. This shows the average difficulty and fun scores given by the (mock) students. This has been implemented using Victory charts.

## Second challenge
Each student has his/her own routing via a button. The bar from the first challenge will change upon arriving on this routing and will show only the scores given by the selected person. This had been implemented.

## Third challenge
Design something to be proud of. Add CSS to style the page. This part is currently still being developed.

## Fourth challenge (bonus)
Create a routing that allows you to select an assignment and see the scores per student. This was implemented.

## Fifth challenge (bonus)
Allow the data to be sliced, showing only the 'fun' or 'difficult' graphs. This was implemented using checkboxes.

## Sixth challenge (bonus)
Add student profiles to their respective pages. This was implemented using mock data generated by Mockaroo (https://www.mockaroo.com/). Student profile pictures were generated by RoboHash (https://robohash.org/)

## Challenges to be created still
- Sorting charts from high to low and vice versa for both fun and difficulty
- Show a line graph with average grades for fun and difficulty
- Checkboxes to include/exclude students in the bars
- Show a table with all data
- Be able to sort said table.


#### Other stuff
This challenge was designed by Winc Academy for the Frontend Development course.
The mock students were part of the given information for the challenge. All other data is fake.
Previous students already coded this assignment. Inspiration to create this app was taken from: https://thirsty-shaw-c47d5c.netlify.app/ and https://friendly-albattani-9cf1ae.netlify.app/ .

This project was bootstrapped with Create-React-App.
