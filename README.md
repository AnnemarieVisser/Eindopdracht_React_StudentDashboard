# React Student Dashboard

This project is created as the final assignment of the Frontend development couse of Winc Academy. 

## First challenge
Create a student dashboard that shows the average scores of the various modules. This shows the average difficulty and fun scores given by the (mock) students. This has been implemented using Victory charts.

## Second challenge
Each student has his/her own routing via a button. The bar from the first challenge will change upon arriving on this routing and will show only the scores given by the selected person. This had been implemented.

## Third challenge
Create a routing that allows you to select an assignment and see the scores per student. This was implemented.
